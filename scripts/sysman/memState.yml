            [out] Number of Virtual Function(VF) instances associated with memory module to monitor the utilization of hardware across all VFs from a Physical Function (PF) instance.
            This count represents the number of VF instances that are actively using the resource represented by the memory module handle.

            [in,out] Pointer to the number of VF memory state structures.
              - if count is zero, the driver shall update the value with the total number of memory module states available.
              - if count is greater than the total number of memory states available, the driver shall update the value with the correct number of memory states available.
              - The count returned is the sum of number of VF instances currently available and the PF instance.

            [in,out][optional][range(0, *pCount)] array of memory state structures.
              - if count is less than the total number of memory states available, then driver shall only retrieve that number of states.
              - the implementation shall populate the vector with memory state for PF at index 0 of the vector followed by user provided pCount-1 number of VF memory states.
